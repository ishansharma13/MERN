React is a javascript library that is used to build user interfaces, 
it is used to create user interfaces that are highly reactive and is seen by the user
runs on client side 
components are created

from parent to child --> props

from child to parent ---> f1 (func in child comp) ; f2 (func in parent comp)

add data in child comp pass it to f1, call f2 inside f1 with data as input parameter.


once react renders data on html, it does not re render unless told so by changing the state
